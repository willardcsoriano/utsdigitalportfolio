        <p>Module 2 of 'Understanding the Self' has been instrumental in shaping me into a more introspective and aware individual. Through the comprehensive study of various dimensions of self—including mental, emotional, spiritual, and socio-digital aspects—this module has profoundly deepened my understanding of myself and my interactions with the world. The reflective activities, such as examining my past, present, and future, and participating in heartfelt discussions during the 'Online Kapihan' sessions, encouraged me to confront and navigate complex personal experiences and emotions. This process has not only heightened my self-awareness but has also enhanced my empathy towards others, allowing me to appreciate the diverse perspectives and struggles encountered by my peers. As a result, I have become more compassionate and thoughtful in my daily interactions, carrying these insights into my professional and personal relationships. The module’s focus on emotional intelligence and resilience has equipped me with the tools to better manage stress and approach challenges with a balanced perspective, making me a stronger, more adaptive, and considerate person. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Despite these positive aspects, the module was not without its challenges. The workload was quite substantial, at times feeling overwhelming. Balancing the in-depth assignments with the reflective exercises and group interactions along with major subjects required significant time management and effort, which could occasionally detract from the overall learning experience. This aspect of the course could perhaps be adjusted to better align the workload with the students' capacity to absorb and reflect on the material without feeling overextended.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Overall, while the intense workload was a notable concern, the educational value of Module 2 remained exceptionally high. I deeply appreciated how the module facilitated not only academic learning but also personal growth and community building. The integration of theoretical knowledge with practical, real-world applications through various activities made this module both challenging and rewarding. It stands out as a pivotal educational experience that effectively prepared us for both personal and professional growth.</p>
