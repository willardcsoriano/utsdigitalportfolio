        <p>I started being physically active around the age of 10 when I began making friends in our subdivision. Before this, I was quite inactive and overweight, a state that could be partly attributed to genetic predispositions inherited from my family. However, as I engaged more with my peers, I took up various sports such as basketball, swimming, volleyball, and badminton. This transition marked a significant phase of maturation; not just physically growing but also developing and honing my physical skills and coordination. </p>

      </figure>
      <div class="paragraphClass">
        <p>From ages 10 to 20, my engagement in sports not only reshaped my body but also my mental quickness and academic learning. This period illustrates the dual role of heredity and environment in shaping our physical selvesâ€”while we may inherit certain physical predispositions, our environment and activities significantly modulate these traits. In line with the concepts of heredity and maturation explained in the course materials, my physical activities during this critical developmental window helped leverage my genetic potential, enabling better health and enhanced cognitive function. </p>

      <div class="paragraphClass">
        <p>The regular physical activities were not just instrumental in altering my physical appearance and capabilities; they also had profound implications for my learning processes. Engaging in sports helped in reducing tension and anxiety, which are often barriers to effective learning. Consequently, this made me quicker to think and more focused, traits that gave me an academic edge over my more sedentary classmates. This correlation underscores the concept that physical health and mental agility are interconnected, and both are crucial for holistic development.</p>

        <p>Looking back, it's clear how genetics, physical activity, and personal growth experiences all played a part in shaping who I am today. Each element, from my DNA to the sports I embraced, was crucial in crafting me. This journey has not only deepened my understanding of my physical self but also solidified the importance of nurturing all aspects of myself for a balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
