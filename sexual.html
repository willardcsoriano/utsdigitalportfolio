        <p>I have always identified as a straight man. Growing up, discussions about sex were absent at home; my parents never broached the topic of sex education. Consequently, my initial understanding of sexuality was shaped almost exclusively through the biological lessons provided in school, which focused primarily on the physical mechanics of sex, sidelining its emotional, spiritual, and cognitive dimensions. This narrow perspective left a significant gap in my comprehension, making me susceptible to the often-distorted portrayals of sexuality in media and entertainment.</p>

      <div class="paragraphClass">
        <p>Around age 20, I started seeing sexual activity differently. This shift came as I began grasping its broader implications and deeper significance. Further education and personal experiences played a role in this realization: I came to understand that sex serves primarily for reproduction of married couples. </p>

      <div class="paragraphClass">
        <p>While I valued exploring the emotional and spiritual dimensions of intimacy, my perspective shifted towards honoring sex's inherent creative power. The profound energy released during sexual activity extends beyond the physicalâ€”it encompasses emotional, mental, and spiritual realms. Through celibacy until marriage and procreation, I came to see the potential to harness this potent force. From a practical viewpoint, it made me consider whether these energies could be better directed toward achieving other, possibly more impactful, goals. This wasn't about denying pleasure, but rather, about directing this energy towards personal growth, or the creation of new life within a committed partnership, for the betterment and safety of the whole world.</p>

        <p>Comprehensive sex education empowers young adults to make informed decisions about their sexual health. This includes understanding the biology of reproduction, potential consequences of sexual activity, and the variety of contraception methods available. It's also valuable to explore healthy relationships, communication, and personal values. By fostering a combination of scientific knowledge and personal reflection, young adults can develop a responsible and fulfilling approach to their sexuality.</p>

      <div class="paragraphClass">
        <p>While understanding the biology of reproduction is important, it's equally crucial to equip young adults with the skills to study emotional aspects of intimacy, healthy relationships, and responsible decision-making. Emphasis on technicalities over moral development can lead young adults to make serious mistakes. For instance, they may engage in casual sex and reckless behavior without fully understanding the consequences, driven by curiosity and hormonal impulses. Such actions are inappropriate for young people who are not yet emotionally and financially mature. </p>

        <p>I was fortunate to be born to parents who were both emotionally and financially prepared for parenthood. However, many of my friends had vastly different experiences, facing significant challenges while growing up. Some never had the chance to meet their fathers, while others only had fleeting glimpses of them. Some endured prolonged separations from their parents due to work abroad, while others had to assume adult responsibilities, balancing studies with the need to earn a living. Still, others faced financial constraints that curtailed their access to basic necessities.</p>

      <div class="paragraphClass">
        <p>Through these firsthand experiences, I've gained profound insight into the consequences of engaging in sexual activity outside of a responsible context. Ultimately, my view of sex leans towards the practical side. While I acknowledge the potential for emotional and spiritual connection within sexual activity, I believe these aspects are supplemental to its primary biological function. Comprehensive moral education, however, remains vital for responsible and informed decision-making, regardless of one's personal beliefs about sex.</p>
